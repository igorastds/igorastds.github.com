							<p>It is a best idea to ask me for Golang skills and for recent EOS/ETH development related knowledge, I’m also ready for Android ROM development. Although I do C++ development since 2008, its not my preffered language and my skills are likely equal to middle-level full-time developer staying with C++11.</p>

									<b>Development: C++;</b>
									Started using in 2008 with Linux-based environment. Worked on a DoD TRMC project as a subcontractor for 1-2 years, doing Windows/Linux network stack drivers. Worked for a large Russian broker/market-maker software developer (Aggregator FX)
								</div>
								<div class="item">

								</div>

							<div class="ui list">
								<div class="item">- My reasons to work remote/do late hours and freelance are that I love to travel, and my personal project takes a lot of funding to makes ends meet, no VC involved at all and commercial applications are delayed up to Beta stage. Also working in that way adds a lot of extra experiences such as managing non-coding tasks, meeting new people and staying trendy.</div>
								<div class="item">- I don’t use Github as code storage because I’ve grown in the time where it was common and easy to set up a personal server and do all the sysops/backup routines by myself, and also 99% things I work on are non-opensource and/or non-public and business-critical know-hows. That said, I have to commit fixes here and there sometimes, I use it for collaboration when possible, and it serves as a good identity platform.</div>
								<div class="item">- Usually I work with Netherlandse, Ukrainian and Iranian people.</div>
